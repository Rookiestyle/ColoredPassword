The plugin handles password fields and can also color passwords in the entry list.

# Configuration
ColoredPassword integrates into KeePass' options form.  
![Options](images/ColoredPassword%20-%20Options.png)

You can define both text- and background colors for
- letters
- digits
- special characters

# Usage
ColoredPassword will color passwords only if the password itself is shown.  

If passwords are hidden using asterisks, no coloring takes place.
If showing passwords is not allowed in KeePass' policies, no coloring takes place.

If you configured Keepass to show passwords in the entry list and decided to have them colored as well, you can optionally decide to **not** change the background color.  
This will ensure the entire line will have the same background color, but - depending on the colors you picked - can result in decreased readability.

## Example - Editing entries and entering the masterkey
